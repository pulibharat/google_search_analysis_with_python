## 🔹 Project Tasks
1. **Keyword-based Analysis**  
   - Change the keyword in the code to analyze multiple search terms.  

2. **Top 15 Countries by Search Volume**  
   - Extract the top 15 countries where the keyword is searched the most.  
   - Create bar charts/visuals for better understanding.  

3. **World Map Visualization** 🌍  
   - Plot a **choropleth map** to show which countries search the keyword the most.  

4. **Time-wise Interest** ⏳  
   - Analyze how the keyword trended over different years.  
   - Visualize using line graphs.  

5. **Related Keywords Comparison**  
   - Compare related keywords.  
   - Plot graphs to see how their popularity changes over time.

## 🔹 Real-World Relevance
Imagine you are working in a **data-driven job role** such as:
- Market Research  
- Business Intelligence  
- Product Strategy  
- Media & News Analysis  

You need to answer questions like:  
- 📌 *Where is my product/service being searched the most?*  
- 📌 *How has the interest changed over the years?*  
- 📌 *What related products/keywords are trending?*  

This project shows how to answer such questions using Google Trends data.
